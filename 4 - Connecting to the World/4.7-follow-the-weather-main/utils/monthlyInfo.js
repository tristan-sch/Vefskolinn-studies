You can prepare but you can’t really know exactly what the weather will do. The amount of rain will depend on where you are but doesn’t differ too much from August. The average is around 3 inches (76mm) of rain, but Dalatangi can get up 6.3 inches (160mm) and Akureyri only gets an average of 1.5 (39mm). Wherever you are, you should always be prepared for rain. Shifting from August to September, you will lose 3 hours of daylight, from 16 to 13 hours of sun.",

The average amount of rain is 4 to 5 inches, or 101-127 mm. But as always, the rain amount depends on which part of Iceland you are visiting. Places like Reykjavík and Stykkishólmur only get around 3.2 to 3.4 inches of rain (80-86 mm), but Dalatangi and Kirkjubæjarklaustur get 7 inches or more (178 mm). Either way, be prepared to get a little wet. Travelers should expect windy and cloudy days and might even see snowflakes falling on colder days. October also features around 9 hours of daylight with the sun rising just before 8. This allows for the possibility of sunrise photography at a reasonable hour.",
